TODO :

fetchRemote - use this method to download all the files in the background.

How are we going do to this?
Once player logs in he gets a cutscene and some information about the game..while this is going on we can download the files in the background. This way the player is not waiting for the files. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

IDEA :

----- FISHING ;D position : 838 : -1907 : 13
----- Auction house system













function loadVehicleUpgrade(p)
	if (isElement(p) and isLoggedIn(p)) then
		local upgrades = nil
		local vehicleId = nil
		local slotName = "slotname"
		local wheels = ""
		personalVehicleUpgrade[p] = {}
		local newPersonalString = {}
		local vehicles = executeSQLQuery("SELECT * FROM servername_vehicles WHERE vehicleOwner=?", getLoginName(p))
		for i, value in ipairs(vehicles) do
			if (value ~= nil) then
				if (value.vehicleUpgrades ~= nil) then
					vehicleId = value.vehicleid
					upgrades = fromJSON(value.vehicleUpgrades)								
					if (upgrades ~= nil) then
						for i, value in pairs(upgrades) do
							if (vehicleId ~= nil) then
								newPersonalString[p] = ""
								wheels = ""
								for x in string.gmatch(value, "%S+") do
									slotName = getVehicleUpgradeSlotName(x)
									if (slotName == wheels) then
										wheels = slotName
										newPersonalString[p] = tostring(x)
										if (personalVehicleUpgrade[p][vehicleId] ~= nil) then
											personalVehicleUpgrade[p][vehicleId] = personalVehicleUpgrade[p][vehicleId].." " ..newPersonalString[p]
										else
											personalVehicleUpgrade[p][vehicleId] = newPersonalString[p]
										end
										slotName = getVehicleUpgradeSlotName ( x )
										setVehicleUpgrades(p, vehicleId, x, slotName)
									else
										outputChatBox("x : " ..x, p, 255, 0, 0)
									end
